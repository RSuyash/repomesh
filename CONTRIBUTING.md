# Contributing

## Commit format
Use conventional commits:
- `feat(scope): summary`
- `fix(scope): summary`
- `docs(scope): summary`
- `test(scope): summary`
- `chore(scope): summary`

## Workflow
1. Create a short-lived feature branch from `main`.
2. Commit atomic changes.
3. Run tests before merge.
4. Merge with non-fast-forward history for milestone traceability.
